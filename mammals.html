                                            <p>The harp seal is a true seal that lives in the north Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, 
                                                spending long periods of time associated with sea ice . 
                                                This species gets its common name from the harp-shaped markings on the back of the otherwise darkly colored adults. 
                                                Young pups are solid white. This species is highly migratory, 
                                                with individuals following Arctic sea ice as it expands and contracts throughout the year.
                                            </P>
                                            <hr>
                                            <h4>

                                            <p>Harp seals are foraging predators that eat several dozen species of bony fishes and invertebrates.  
                                                They will eat just about anything they can catch.  Juveniles eat krill and other pelagic crustaceans, 
                                                and the diet diversifies as they grow.  Adult harp seals are eaten by killer whales and large sharks.  
                                                Juveniles are eaten by polar bears and other terrestrial predators, including foxes and wolves.</P>
                                            <hr>
                                            <h4>
                                                Reproduction
                                            </h4>
                                            <p>Courtship among harp seals takes place on the ice surface, but mating typically occurs in the water.  
                                                Both males and females may mate with several partners during the mating season.  Like all mammals, 
                                                harp seals reproduce via internal fertilization and give birth to live young.  
                                                Pups are born on the ice surface and are nursed by their mothers for only 12 days.  
                                                After the nursing period, the pup is still quite helpless and unable to hunt for several weeks.  During that time, 
                                                it derives energy from its fat reserves, may lose up to 50% of its body weight, and is particularly vulnerable to predators.</P>

                                            <p>The beluga whale is a relatively small toothed whale that is brown-gray at birth and bright white in adulthood. 
                                                The beluga is one of just two species in the “white whales” family, the other being the narwhal. 
                                                As they are closely related and do not have the characteristic tusk of the males, 
                                                juvenile and female Narwhals can be incorrectly identified as belugas.<br/>
                                               Belugas, however, are typically more solidly white than their grayish cousins.  
                                                Adult belugas are also slightly larger than Narwhals, reaching lengths of around 18 feet (5.5 m).  
                                                Interestingly, the beluga whale is the only species of cetacean (whales and dolphins) that has a movable neck.  
                                                 Belugas can move their heads up and down and from side to side.

                                            <p>Beluga whales are restricted to the Arctic Ocean and adjacent waters.  
                                                They feed in shallow, coastal waters during the summer and near the ice edge [link] in winter.  
                                                Some populations undergo long, seasonal migrations, while others are more resident in nature.  
                                                They eat a variety of fish and invertebrate prey.  Killer whales and polar bears have been known to attack and eat beluga whales.  
                                                Scientists believe that belugas may swim far into ice-covered waters to avoid Killer Whales but that this may put them in greater risk of predation by Polar Bears.  When hunting belugas, 
                                                polar bears use their incredible strength to pull them onto the ice surface whenever they come to a hole to breathe.</P>

                                            <p>Occasionally, belugas can be observed far inland, swimming up coastal rivers as far as hundreds of miles.  
                                                Scientists do not know if these trips into freshwater are for feeding or for other purposes,
                                                but belugas are apparently unafraid of very shallow water.  In fact, 
                                                some individuals have been known to survive being stranded/beached by patiently waiting for the return of the high tide.  
                                                Belugas are also known for their loud, clear vocalizations. 
                                                 They often “sing,” and can even be heard above the ocean surface by people in boats or onshore. </P>

                                                within these dens during the dry season. Otters dig their reproductive
                                                dens on the shores of oxbow lakes starting around July, when waters are
                                                already quite low. They give birth between August and September, and
                                                the young pups emerge for the first time in October and November, which
                                                are the months of lowest water and fish concentrations in the dwindling
                                                lakes and channels are at their peak. This makes it easier for the adults
                                                to catch enough fish for the growing young, and for the pups to learn
                                                how to catch fish. The entire group, including nonreproductive adults,

                                            <p>The sea otter (Enhydralutris) is a marine mammal native to the coasts of
                                                the northern and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adult sea otters typically
                                                weigh between 14 and 45 kg (31 and 99 lb), making them the heaviest members
                                                of the weasel family, but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most
                                                marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally
                                                thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can
                                                walk on land, the sea otter lives mostly in the ocean.</P>

                                            <p>Sea otters consume over 100 different prey species. In most of its range,
                                                the sea otter's diet consists almost exclusively of marine benthic invertebrates,
                                                including sea urchins, fat innkeeper worms, a variety of bivalves such
                                                as clams and mussels, abalone, other mollusks, crustaceans, and snails.
                                                Its prey ranges in size from tiny limpets and crabs to giant octopuses.
                                                Where prey such as sea urchins, clams, and abalone are present in a range
                                                of sizes, sea otters tend to select larger items over smaller ones of
                                                similar type. In California, they have been noted to ignore Pismo clams
                                                smaller than 3 inches (7 cm) across.</P>

                                            <p>Sea otters have the thickest fur of any mammal. Their beautiful fur is a
                                                main target for many hunters. Archaeological evidence indicates that
                                                for thousands of years, indigenous peoples have hunted sea otters for
                                                food and fur. Large-scale hunting, part of the Maritime Fur Trade, which
                                                would eventually kill approximately one million sea otters, began in
                                                the 18th century when hunters and traders began to arrive from all over
                                                the world to meet foreign demand for otter pelts, which were one of the
                                                world's most valuable types of fur.</P>

                                            <p>Sea otters are polygynous: males have multiple female partners. However,
                                                temporary pair-bonding occurs for a few days between a female in estrus
                                                and her mate. Mating takes place in the water and can be rough, the male
                                                biting the female on the muzzle – which often leaves scars on the nose
                                                – and sometimes holding her head under water.<br> Births occur year-round,
                                                with peaks between May and June in northern populations and between January
                                                and March in southern populations.[69] Gestation appears to vary from
                                                four to twelve months, as the species is capable of delayed implantation
                                                followed by four months of pregnancy. In California, sea otters usually
                                                breed every year, about twice as often as those in Alaska. </P>
