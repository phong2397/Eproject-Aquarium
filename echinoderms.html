                                                    balance that is in equilibrium with sea water. This means that it is
                                                    only possible for them to live in a marine environment and they are not
                                                    found in any freshwater habitats. Starfish species inhabit all of the
                                                    world's oceans. Habitats range from tropical coral reefs, rocky shores,

                                                    if needed, opening the shell), they bring their stomachs outside of their

                                                    One reason for this may be because of the way they reproduce, by spawning:
                                                    females cast eggs into the water, and males cast sperm into the water;
                                                    it mixes and creates sea star embryos. Sea stars may also feed from the
                                                    same piece of food, another potential reason that they stay close together.

                                                <p>Sexual reproduction:<br> Most species of starfish are gonochorous, there
                                                    being separate male and female individuals. These are usually not distinguishable
                                                    externally as the gonads cannot be seen, but their sex is apparent when
                                                    they spawn. Some species are simultaneous hermaphrodites, producing eggs
                                                    and sperm at the same time and in a few of these, the same gonad, called
                                                    an ovotestis, produces both eggs and sperm. Other starfish are sequential
                                                    hermaphrodites. Protandrous individuals of species like Asterinagibbosa
                                                    start life as males before changing sex into females as they grow older.
                                                    In some species such as Nepanthiabelcheri, a large female can split in
                                                    half and the resulting offspring are males. When these grow large enough
                                                    they change back into females.<br> Asexual reproduction:<br> Some species
                                                    of starfish are able to reproduce asexually as adults either by fission
                                                    of their central discs or by autotomy of one or more of their arms. Which
                                                    of these processes occurs depends on the genus. Among starfish that are
                                                    able to regenerate their whole body from a single arm, some can do so
                                                    even from fragments just 1 cm (0.4 in) long. Single arms that regenerate
                                                    a whole individual are called comet forms. The division of the starfish,
                                                    either across its disc or at the base of the arm, is usually accompanied
                                                    by a weakness in the structure that provides a fracture zone.

                                                <p>Holothuroidea are generally scavengers, feeding on debris in the benthic
                                                    zone of the ocean. Exceptions include some pelagic cucumbers and the
                                                    species Rynkatorpapawsoni, which has a commensal relationship with deep-sea
                                                    anglerfish. The diet of most cucumbers consists of plankton and decaying
                                                    organic matter found in the sea. Some sea cucumbers position themselves
                                                    in currents and catch food that flows by with their open tentacles. They
                                                    also sift through the bottom sediments using their tentacles. Other species
                                                    can dig into bottom silt or sand until they are completely buried. They
                                                    then extrude their feeding tentacles, ready to withdraw at any hint of

                                                    sand during the day. Some sea urchins use their tube feet to pick up

                                                    Some urchins even carry live soft corals or anemones. This form of camouflage

                                                    protection. The fertilized egg, once met with the free-floating sperm
