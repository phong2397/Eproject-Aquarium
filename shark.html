                                            <p>Sixgills are a common species in deep waters all over the world. Typically found at depths of below 200 feet (and even up to 8,000 feet), they generally avoid shallow waters. However, they have been
                                                sighted in waters as shallow as 20 feet in Puget Sound and British Columbia — providing us with a rare opportunity to learn more about these elusive creatures.
                                            </P>

                                            <p>Bluntnosesixgill sharks are strong predators. Adults are very sensitive to and become distressed by light exposure — thus, they spend the day in the dark depths, and forage closer to the surface mainly
                                                at night. They are generalists, feeding on a great variety of prey items that are likely ambushed at close range. The diet includes other sharks, skates and rays, many kinds of large bony fish,
                                            and invertebrates including squid, crabs, sea cucumbers and shrimp. This shark has also been known to scavenge on dead animals such as seals, whales, and bait from long-lines set by fishermen.

                                            <p>Little is known about the feeding habits of the sixgill sharks. Based on the few stomach examinations of these sharks, they are thought to feed mainly on small to moderately sized bony fish and crustaceans.
                                                Like all sharks of the order Hexanchiformes found so far, this shark is ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs are retained inside the female's body until hatching. Thesixgill sharks, after an unknown gestation
                                                period, gives birth to litters of up to 13 pups. Because of the size of this shark, their main predators probably are larger sharks.</P>

                                            </h4>
                                            <p>Due to the solitary lifestyle of sixgill sharks, very little is known about their reproductive behavior. Many biologists believe that they meet seasonally, moving to shallower waters between May and
                                                November to mate. Sixgill sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning that the eggs are carried within the mother's body until they hatch. After hatching, still within the mother's body, the young have been
                                                known to eat any unfertilized eggs and even each other. These young sharks, known as pups, are a little more than two feet (about 70 centimeters) in length when they are born. The color of the pups
                                                is lighter than that of the adults, allowing them a certain amount of camoflauge to help hide them from predators. There are between 22 and 108 pups born at any given time. Because of these large
                                                numbers, it is thought that there is an extremely high mortality rate among the pups and not many survive to maturity. Those that do survive are believed to live about 80 years in the wild.</P>

                                            <p>The barndoor skate is one of the largest skates in the world. Skates are closely 
                                                related to the rays and more distantly related to sharks. The skates are the most 
                                                diverse lineage of the cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, and rays). The term 
                                                ‘cartilaginous fishes’ refers to the fact that these groups do not have true bone 
                                                and instead have skeletons made of hardened cartilage. barndoor skates grow to lengths of at least 5 feet (1.5 m) 
                                                and weights up to 44 pounds (20 kg). Historically, they were commercially valuable.

                                            <p>Barndoor skates are active predators on continental shelves off the east coast of North America.  
                                                This species is known to live from shallow coastal waters to depths of at least 2500 feet (750 m).  
                                                Like most skates and rays, they live on the seafloor, where they hunt a variety of invertebrate and fish prey.  
                                                They seemingly eat just about anything that strays too near.  They are even known to eat small sharks.

                                            <p>This species reproduces via internal fertilization, and females spawn clutches of several, well-protected eggs.  
                                                Unlike many fishes that have pelagic eggs, barndoor skates attach their eggs to hard surfaces on the seafloor.  
                                                After laying the eggs, the mother does not provide any further parental care for her offspring.  
                                                Well-developed juveniles hatch and immediately begin a predatory lifestyle.  
                                                Barndoor skates are slow growing and likely do not reach maturity until they are 8-11 years old.  
                                                These life history characteristics make this species vulnerable to overfishing.

                                            <p>The hammerhead sharks are an unmistakable group of sharks that can be 
                                                distinguished from all other fishes by the shape of their heads. The wide, 
                                                hammer-shaped head gives these sharks their common name, and the scalloped 
                                                hammerhead is named for the notches found along the front edge of its head.

                                            <hr>

                                                Foods
                                            </h4>
                                            <p>Like all hammerhead sharks, the scalloped hammerhead is an active predator and 
                                                gains several advantages from the shape of its head.  The widely spaced eyes, 
                                                nostrils, and other senses allow the scalloped hammerhead to more successfully 
                                                ocate its prey near, or buried in, the sea floor.  Also, the scalloped hammerhead 
                                                may use its head to pin stingrays to the bottom, allowing them to successfully eat 
                                                those difficult to capture species.  Finally, like most sharks, the scalloped hammerhead 
                                                has special sensory cells that it can use to detect the electric field given off by all other fishes.  
                                                The wide head likely allows this species to more accurately utilize this sense, again helping it to locate prey buried in the sand.

                                            <p>Historically, the scalloped hammerhead shark could be observed forming very large 
                                                schools of hundreds (or more) adults, but this phenomenon makes the species vulnerable 
                                                to targeted fishing, and many known grouping areas have been mostly depleted.  
                                                Scientists are unsure why scalloped hammerheads form these occasional large groups, 
                                                while maintaining solitary lifestyles for much of the time in between, but they seem to 
                                                be social animals for at least part of the year.  They mate via internal fertilization 
                                                and give birth to live young, which spend several years living in coastal nursery habitat 
                                                before moving to join the adult populations around deeper reefs, seamounts, and other open ecosystems.

                                            as 70 years.

                                                secrete a mild venom. These sharp spines serve as a defense mechanism against the dogfish's predators, such as sixgill sharks and seals.</P>

                                                12 and 25 years of age. Their pregnancies last 22 to 24 months, which is one of the longest gestation periods of any animal. Females give live birth to four to 12 pups, which are immediately able
                                                to hunt for prey.
