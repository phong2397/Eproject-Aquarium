                                                <p>The leafy seadragon is a charismatic species native to the southern coast of Australia.
                                                Though these fish resemble seahorses, they are actually more closely related to the pipefishes, and they may be intermediate between these two groups of fishes.
                                                Leafy seadragons are named for their plant-like appearance that allows them to perfectly blend in with algae that grow in the seagrass beds and the rocky reefs where they live. 
                                                These fish are very poor swimmers and rely on this camouflage to avoid predation. 
                                                They are relatively large compared to their closely related species and reach lengths of up to one foot (30 cm) long.
                                                </P>

                                                <p>Leafy seadragons eat small, plankton crustaceans but are small enough themselves and have sufficient vision to see and attack individual prey (unlike large filter feeders).  
                                                    Their heads are relatively large compared to their very small mouths, so they are able to concentrate enough pressure at their mouths to easily suck in their prey.</P>

                                                <p>Like in seahorses and pipefishes, male leafy seadragons care for the fertilized eggs.  
                                                    They do not have a specialized pouch like male seahorses but instead carry the eggs under the tail.  
                                                    There, they remain exposed to the elements but safe, and the male provides them with necessary levels of oxygen through a specialized, nearby organ.  
                                                    Newly hatched leafy seadragons receive no further parental care.  
                                                    They reach sexual maturity in approximately two years. </P>

                                                    Reaching lengths of at least 8 feet (2.5 m) and weights up to 700 pounds (320 kg), 
                                                    this species is one of the largest predators on coral reefs and along mangrove forests in the Atlantic Ocean and one of the largest groupers in the world.</p>

                                                <p>The Atlantic goliath grouper, like most groupers, is an ambush predator and eats fairly large fishes and invertebrates and even small sharks.  
                                                    Reefs with large numbers of predators, like Atlantic goliath groupers, are known to be healthier than reefs with no predators, so this species may represent an important part of the reef food web.  
                                                    Atlantic goliath groupers feed by swallowing their prey whole; they do not chew.  
                                                    They use their very large mouths to create enough negative pressure to suck in whole fishes or large invertebrates, and they swallow them quickly and efficiently.

                                                    A closely related species, the Pacific Goliath Grouper, is restricted to the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean from Mexico to Peru.  
                                                    Scientists only recently divided the species into two, based on their slightly different genetic makeup.  
                                                    The two species are similar in both appearance and behavior, but little is known about the population trends or conservation status of the Pacific goliath grouper.

                                                    They are at the top of their food web and are therefore naturally rare.  
                                                    However, during reproduction (immediately after the full moons between June and December), they come together in groups of at least 100 individuals.  
                                                    These groups are known as spawning aggregations, and they form at relatively few places throughout the species’ range.  
                                                    Individual Atlantic goliath grouper likely travel many miles to reach their preferred spawning sites and form part of the spawning aggregation.  
                                                    At these sites, the groupers reproduce by a method known as broadcast spawning, where females release eggs and several males release sperm into the water column above deep reefs all at the same time.  
                                                    This method increases the likelihood that eggs will become successfully fertilized and that fertilized eggs will not be eaten by egg predators on the reef surface.

                                                    Like all clownfishes (also called anemonefishes), common clownfish live within the tentacles of a variety of venomous anemones. 
                                                    Mucous covers each individual’s body and protects the fish from the anemone’s stinging cells that it uses to kill other fishes to eat. 
                                                    This relationship provides the common clownfish with some protection from predation by other fishes, and in return, the common clownfish removes parasites and chases away species they may try to eat its host anemone.</P>

                                                <p>Though they spend much of their lives swimming among the tentacles of their host anemone, common clownfish occasionally leave to feed.  
                                                    They are plankton pickers, which means they visually seek and eat individual zooplankton or phytoplankton floating in the water column.  
                                                    They also likely eat algae from the reef surface.  
                                                    Because of the protection afforded them by their host anemones, common clownfish have few predators, but they are at risk of predation when they leave the anemone to feed.

                                                <p>The common clownfish’s lifecycle is both interesting and rare.  
                                                    Like all clownfishes, this species changes sex throughout its lifetime.  
                                                    Sex change is not particularly rare, but most species change from female to male.  
                                                    The clownfishes change from male to female.  
                                                    All individuals hatch as males and eventually join groups of a few individuals living together in an anemone.  
                                                    The largest individual of each group is the only female, and she and the largest male are the only two that reproduce.  
                                                    The large, dominant female lays her eggs on the reef surface, and the male fertilizes them.  
                                                    Together, they guard the nest from egg predators until they hatch.  
                                                    If anything happens to the female, the reproductive male changes sex, becoming the dominant female.  
                                                    The next largest male then becomes reproductively active, and the other males in the group continue to be subordinate.

                                                <p>The red lionfish (Pteroisvolitans) is a venomous coral reef fish in the family
                                                    Scorpaenidae, order Scorpaeniformes. P. volitans is natively found in
                                                    the Indo-Pacific region, but has become an invasive problem in the Caribbean
                                                    Sea, as well as along the East Coast of the United States. This and a
                                                    similar species, Pterois miles, have both been deemed as invasive species.
                                                    Red lionfish are clad in white stripes alternated with red/maroon/brown
                                                    stripes. Adults in this species can grow as large as 47 cm (18.5 in)[1]
                                                    in length, making it one of the largest species of lionfish in the ocean,
                                                    while juveniles are typically shorter than 1 inch (2.5 cm). The average
                                                    red lionfish lives around 10 years. As with many species within the Scopaenidae
                                                    family, it has large, venomous spines that protrude from the body, similar
                                                    to a mane, giving it the common name lionfish. The venomous spines make
                                                    the fish inedible or deter most potential predators. Lionfish reproduce
                                                    monthly and are able to quickly disperse during their larval stage for
                                                    expansion of their invasive region. No definitive predators of the lionfish
                                                    are known, and many organizations are promoting the harvest and consumption
                                                    of lionfish in efforts to prevent further increases in the already high

                                                <p>We are recording fish abundance and distribution have noted repeatedly that
                                                    lionfish tend to aggregate around reef structures with plenty of vertical
                                                    relief and crevasses. The lionfish will group together on these reef
                                                    formations, with many individuals swimming in close proximity of one
                                                    another. It appears the lionfish may favor these locations because they
                                                    are full of reef fish activity. Lionfish are often found close to “cleaning
                                                    stations.” A cleaning station is a location on the reef populated by
                                                    small cleaner fish such as wrasses and gobies. These small fish wait
                                                    for a larger parrotfish, barracuda or grouper to approach the station.
                                                    This is a clear indication that it is ready to be cleaned. The cleaning
                                                    is a service the small fish perform with efficiency. They eat loose skin,
                                                    parasites and bacteria off of the larger fish, demonstrating another

                                                    fish also become easy prey for lionfish lying in wait for a good opportunity

                                                    Similar courtship behaviors are observed in all Pterois species, including

                                                    Like all puffers, this species is known for its ability to “puff up” when threatened. 
                                                    The guineafowl puffer gets its common name from its resemblance to guineafowl birds. 
                                                    It is typically black and covered with small white spots. Some individuals, however, are bright gold with only a few spots. 
                                                    These two morphs can be observed swimming together on the same reefs.

                                                <p>The guineafowl puffer, like all puffers, has powerful jaws and beak-like teeth.  
                                                    The teeth of the upper jaw are fused into two tooth plates, as are the teeth in the lower jaw.  
                                                    In fact, the family name for puffers (Tetraodontidae) means “four teeth,” reflecting the two tooth plates that these fishes have in each jaw.  
                                                    Guineafowl puffers are foraging predators that eat a variety of sessile invertebrates.  
                                                    Their preferred prey is branching coral (including lobe coral), but they also occasionally eat sponges, soft corals, and other reef organisms.

                                                <p>The guineafowl puffer is a poor swimmer and can easily be caught by predators.  
                                                    However, when threatened, this species has the incredible ability to swallow water and inflate itself to several times its normal size.  
                                                    Though the process takes a few seconds, it is quite effective at preventing predation.  
                                                    It is very difficult for a predator to swallow an inflated individual.  
                                                    When a guineafowl puffer no longer feels threatened, it uses muscles along its abdomen to push the water back out of its mouth.  
                                                    Even if successfully eaten (before it can inflate), this species can be poisonous to potential predators, as it stores toxins created by symbiotic bacteria that live inside its body.  
                                                    Therefore, this species is rarely eaten.</P>

                                                    Like other seahorses, the longsnout seahorse’s tail is highly maneuverable, and it uses this tail to attach itself to seagrasses, mangrove roots, sponges, soft corals, or other places where it hides.  
                                                    Longsnout seahorses eat tiny plankton but are small enough and have sufficient vision to see and attack individual prey (unlike large filter feeders).  
                                                    Their heads are relatively large compared to their very small mouths, so they are able to concentrate enough pressure at their mouths to easily suck in their prey.

                                                    Females lay their eggs into specialized pouches on the males’ abdomens, and the males incubate them until they hatch.  
                                                    Furthermore, scientists believe that some seahorses have monogamous relationships and form pairs that stay together for several mating seasons in a row.

                                                    Queen angelfish reproduce via broadcast spawning, where the female releases her eggs and the male releases his sperm, in the water column above the reef, at the same time.  
                                                    This method increases the likelihood that eggs will be fertilized and that fertilized eggs will not be eaten by egg predators on the reef surface.

                                                <p>The queen parrotfish is a medium sized parrotfish that lives on coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea and its adjacent waters. 
                                                    The parrotfishes are named for their powerful beaks, formed from the fusing of the teeth into biting plates. 
                                                    The largest queen parrotfish are brightly colored (blue, green, orange, etc.), and the species gets its name from a series of markings on the head, above the eye, that resemble a crown. 
                                                    Juveniles and young adults are a somewhat drab, brownish color.
                                                </P>

                                                <p>Queen parrotfish are herbivores that graze the reef, using their beaks to scrape plants and algae from the reef surface.  
                                                    Oftentimes, this habit involves ingesting corals and other animals as well, but they are primarily herbivorous.  
                                                    Through their feeding strategies, parrotfishes create much of the sand around a reef. 
                                                    Upon eating some species of calcareous algae (i.e., algae with a hard skeleton), parrotfishes digest the soft parts and pass the hard parts, which essentially take the form of sand.  
                                                    Through their constant grazing, queen parrotfish serve an important ecological function on coral reefs.  
                                                    By removing algae, they open up space on hard surfaces for corals to attach and grow.

                                                <p>Several species of large bony fishes and sharks eat queen parrotfish both as juveniles and adults. 
                                                    At night, this species is known to find protected places on the reef to sleep.  
                                                    Before sleeping, individuals of this species surround their bodies with a cocoon-like structure of mucus that provides them some protection from predators (via its bad taste and its likelihood of waking up the parrotfish if touched). </P>

                                                    Reproduction
                                                </h4>
                                                <p>This species reproduces through a behavior known as broadcast spawning, where females release eggs and males release sperm into the water column above the reef, at the same time.  
                                                    This method increases the likelihood that eggs will become successfully fertilized and that fertilized eggs will not be eaten by egg predators on the reef surface.  
                                                    Interestingly, all queen parrotfish hatch as females.  As they mature, the largest individuals become male.  
                                                    Only during that transition do they lose their drab, brown color and become the brightly colored individuals that we think of when imagining this species.  
                                                    Ironically, the “crowns” that give the queen parrotfish its common name are only found on males!</P>
