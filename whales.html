                                                In captivity, they can be seen to be constantly playing, vocalizing, and swimming around each other. They show a great deal of curiosity towards humans and frequently approach the windows in the tanks to observe them. Belugas may also playfully spit at humans or other whales. It is not unusual for an aquarium handler to be drenched by one of his charges. Some researchers believe spitting originated with blowing sand away from crustaceans at the sea bottom.<br>
                                                
                                                Belugas also show a great degree of curiosity towards humans in the wild, and frequently swim alongside boats.They also play with objects they find in the water; in the wild, they do this with wood, plants, dead fish, and bubbles they have created. During the breeding season, adults have been observed carrying objects such as plants, nets, and even the skeleton of a dead reindeer on their heads and backs. Captive females have also been observed displaying this behaviour, carrying items such as floats and buoys, after they have lost a calf; experts consider this interaction with the objects could be acting as a substitute behaviour.</P>

                                            <p>Male belugas in captivity can mimic the pattern of human speech, several octaves lower than typical whale calls. It is not the first time a beluga has been known to sound human, and they often shout like children, in the wild. One captive beluga, after overhearing divers using an underwater communication system, caused one of the divers to surface by imitating their order to get out of the water. Subsequent recordings confirmed that the beluga had become skilled at imitating the patterns and frequency of human speech. After several years, this beluga ceased making these sounds.</P>

Individual whales are typically identified using photographs of their dorsal surface and matching the scars and patches associated with parasites that have fallen off the whale or are still attached. They have two blowholes on top of their head, which can create a distinctive heart-shaped blow at the surface in calm wind conditions.

                                            <p>The whale feeds mainly on benthic crustaceans, which it eats by turning on its side (usually the right, resulting in loss of eyesight in the right eye for many older animals[citation needed]) and scooping up sediments from the sea floor. This unique feeding selection makes gray whales one of the most strongly reliant on coastal waters among baleen whales. It is classified as a baleen whale and has baleen, or whalebone, which acts like a sieve, to capture small sea animals, including amphipods taken in along with sand, water and other material. Mostly, the animal feeds in the northern waters during the summer; and opportunistically feeds during its migration, depending primarily on its extensive fat reserves. Calf gray whales drink 190–300 US gal (720–1,140 l) of their mothers' 53% fat milk per day.</P>

                                            <p>Breeding behavior is complex and often involves three or more animals. Both male and female whales reach puberty at approximately eight years of age.Females show highly synchronized reproduction, undergoing oestrus in late November to early December.During the breeding season, it is common for females to have several mates. This single ovulation event is believed to coincide with the species’ annual migration patterns, when births can occur in warmer waters. Most females show biennial reproduction, although annual births have been reported. Males also show seasonal changes, experiencing an increase in testes mass that correlates with the time females undergo oestrus. Currently there are no accounts of twin births, although an instance of twins in utero has been reported. </P>

                                                <p>Limited hunting of gray whales has continued since that time, however, primarily in the Chukotka region of northeastern Russia, where large numbers of gray whales spend the summer months. This hunt has been allowed under an "aboriginal/subsistence whaling" exception to the commercial-hunting ban. Anti-whaling groups have protested the hunt, saying the meat from the whales is not for traditional native consumption, but is used instead to feed animals in government-run fur farms; they cite annual catch numbers that rose dramatically during the 1940s, at the time when state-run fur farms were being established in the region. Although the Soviet government denied these charges as recently as 1987, in recent years the Russian government has acknowledged the practice. </p>

                                            <p>Killer whales are found in all oceans and most seas. Due to their enormous range, numbers, and density, distributional estimates are difficult to compare,but they clearly prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas over pelagic environments. Areas which serve as major study sites for the species include the coasts of Iceland, Norway, the Valdes Peninsula of Argentina, the Crozet Islands, New Zealand and parts of the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska.

                                            <p>Killer whales are apex predators, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles.Different populations or ecotypes may specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species.However, whales that inhabit tropical areas appear to have more generalized diets due to lower food productivity.</P>

                                                Day-to-day killer whale behaviour generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour at the surface such as breaching (jumping completely out of the water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.<br>
                                                
                                                Resident killer whales swim with porpoises, other dolphins, seals, and sea lions, which are common prey for transient killer whales.</P>

                                            <p>Like other animals at the highest trophic levels, the killer whale is particularly at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.</P>

                                            <p>The sea otter (Enhydralutris) is a marine mammal native to the coasts of
                                                the northern and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adult sea otters typically
                                                weigh between 14 and 45 kg (31 and 99 lb), making them the heaviest members
                                                of the weasel family, but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most
                                                marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally
                                                thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can
                                                walk on land, the sea otter lives mostly in the ocean.</P>

                                            <p>Sea otters consume over 100 different prey species. In most of its range,
                                                the sea otter's diet consists almost exclusively of marine benthic invertebrates,
                                                including sea urchins, fat innkeeper worms, a variety of bivalves such
                                                as clams and mussels, abalone, other mollusks, crustaceans, and snails.
                                                Its prey ranges in size from tiny limpets and crabs to giant octopuses.
                                                Where prey such as sea urchins, clams, and abalone are present in a range
                                                of sizes, sea otters tend to select larger items over smaller ones of
                                                similar type. In California, they have been noted to ignore Pismo clams
                                                smaller than 3 inches (7 cm) across.</P>

                                            <p>Sea otters have the thickest fur of any mammal. Their beautiful fur is a
                                                main target for many hunters. Archaeological evidence indicates that
                                                for thousands of years, indigenous peoples have hunted sea otters for
                                                food and fur. Large-scale hunting, part of the Maritime Fur Trade, which
                                                would eventually kill approximately one million sea otters, began in
                                                the 18th century when hunters and traders began to arrive from all over
                                                the world to meet foreign demand for otter pelts, which were one of the
                                                world's most valuable types of fur.</P>

                                            <p>Sea otters are polygynous: males have multiple female partners. However,
                                                temporary pair-bonding occurs for a few days between a female in estrus
                                                and her mate. Mating takes place in the water and can be rough, the male
                                                biting the female on the muzzle – which often leaves scars on the nose
                                                – and sometimes holding her head under water.<br> Births occur year-round,
                                                with peaks between May and June in northern populations and between January
                                                and March in southern populations.[69] Gestation appears to vary from
                                                four to twelve months, as the species is capable of delayed implantation
                                                followed by four months of pregnancy. In California, sea otters usually
                                                breed every year, about twice as often as those in Alaska. </P>
