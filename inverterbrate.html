                                            <p>Most people associate corals with tropical waters—but you may be surprised
                                                to find that a stunning variety of corals live off the coast in the decidedly
                                                chilly waters of the Pacific Northwest. They make their homes in deep
                                                water on rocky reefs along the Olympic Coast, all the way up through
                                                Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.</p> Unlike their warm-water counterparts,
                                            these corals take food right out of the water instead of relying on sunlight
                                            and symbiotic algae for sustenance. You can see both warm- and cold-water
                                            corals at the Nexus Aquarium.

                                            <p>To one extent or another, corals do require a certain amount of light in
                                                order to survive. Some corals, however, depend less on light than they
                                                do nutrients extracted from the water column for their nutrition.
                                            Most soft corals, zoanthids, and gorgonians depend almost exclusively on phytoplankton, (small water-borne plants or algae)
                                            for their nutritional needs as well as floating plankton, detritus, and slow
                                            moving invertebrate larvae, rather than zooplankton (which can actively propel
                                            itself).
                                            </p> The third important source of food for corals is bacterioplankton, which
                                            consists of free-living bacteria as well as the bacteria associated with
                                            various materials in the water (mucas, dead plant material, and other particulate
                                            matter) which are commonly called detritus or reef snow. Almost all corals
                                            feed heavily on bacterioplankton. Material which includes detritus, floating
                                            eggs, and other material is also known as pseudoplankton.

                                            <p>Coral reefs are, primarily, made by stony corals. Each individual stony coral
                                                polyp secretes a skeleton of calcium carbonate. Over time (a long, long
                                                time!), these skeletons can build up and form massive coral reefs, with
                                                colonies consisting of millions of coral polyps living atop the remains
                                                of former colonies.</p> Most established coral reefs are between 5,000
                                            and 10,000 years old. It’s estimated that some existing reefs began growing
                                            over 50 million years ago!</P>

                                                comes within reach of their tentacles and immobilizing it with the aid
                                                of their nematocysts. The prey is then transported to the mouth and thrust
                                                into the pharynx. The lips can stretch to aid in prey capture and can

                                            <p>When small fish or crustaceans pass by and touch the tentacles around their
                                                mouths, sea anemones shoot a harpoon-like spear or nematocyst into their
                                                prey, injecting a paralyzing neurotoxin. They then use their tentacles
                                                to guide the food into their mouths. Luckily, only a few have stinging
                                                polyps that are harmful to humans.</p> Some colonies of anemones fight
                                            other groups to protect their territories. They live in large “armies” near
                                            each other. “Scouts” look for space to claim. If an anemone from another
                                            group gets too close, “warriors” slap it with special tentacles that leave
                                            patches of stinging cells stuck to the intruder.</p> Some anemones have symbiotic
                                            relationships. The most well known is with the clownfish. A mucus layer protects
                                            the clownfish from the anemone’s sting so it can live safe from predators
                                            within the anemone’s tentacles. The anemone gets the scraps from the fish’s
                                            meals. Some anemones also provide safe harbor to green algae in exchange
                                            for oxygen and sugar, the by-products of the algae's photosynthesis.</P>

                                            were thriving long before the first insects, trees, flowers or dinosaurs.

                                            <p>All jellies are filter feeders: they trap tiny, planktonic organisms with
                                                stinging cells and then transport these food items to their mouth. A
                                                few species, including spotted lagoon jellies, are also photosynthetic.
                                                They culture algae within their bodies and it’s this algae that converts
                                                the sun’s energy into useful products like sugars and oxygen. This is
                                                essentially the exact same process seen in most tropical corals, giant
                                                clams and some sponges.</p> In the sheltered waters where they are normally
                                            found, spotted lagoon jellies follow the sun as it travels from east to west,
                                            then they sink down to lower depths as the sun sets. They are actually strong
                                            swimmers (as jellies go) and are capable of daily migrations to follow available
                                            sunlight in a way that most planktonic animals aren’t.</P>

                                                of that sting varies greatly from species to species. For instance, the
                                                sting of a box jelly, found in the waters around eastern Australia, can

                                                found in Puget Sound aren’t very dangerous—but their stings can still
                                                cause plenty of pain and irritation. It’s best to stay on the safe side
                                                and not touch them. Be careful: even dead jellies that have washed up
                                                on the beach can sting!</P>

                                            <p>Jellyfish reproduction involves several different stages. In the adult, or
                                                medusa, stage of a jellyfish, they can reproduce sexually by releasing
                                                sperm and eggs into the water, forming a planula. In this larval stage
                                                of jellyfish life, the planula hooks on to the bottom of a smooth rock
                                                or other structure and grows into another stage of jellyfish life, the
                                                polyp--which resembles a miniature sea anemone. During this stage, which
                                                can last for several months or years, asexual reproduction occurs. The
                                                polyps clone themselves and bud, or strobilate, into another stage of
                                                jellyfish life, called ephyra. It is this form that grows into the adult
                                                medusa jellyfish.
