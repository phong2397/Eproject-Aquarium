                                                <p>Hermit crabs are decapod crustaceans of the superfamily Paguroidea.<br> Hermit
                                                 crabs evolved from free-living crabs—and some hermit crab species have
                                                 evolved back into free-living species, including Alaskan king crabs and
                                                 porcelain crabs. There are over 500 species of hermit crabs around the
                                                 world, and they’ve evolved a unique body shape to fit into their shell
                                                 homes. Unlike free-living crabs, their abdomens aren’t covered in a hard
                                                 exoskeleton but rather a thin, soft one; their abdomens are also twisted
                                                 to fit the spiral cavity of the snail shells in which they make their
                                                 homes.
                                                </P>

                                                <p>Hermit crabs are pretty easygoing about what they eat. In fact, they’ll dine
                                                 on just about anything they can find in the water that surrounds them,
                                                 including small fish, invertebrates such as worms, plankton and any food
                                                 particles that happen to be floating by.</P>

                                                </h4>
                                                <p>Contrary to popular belief, hermit crabs don’t kill the snails in whose shells
                                                 they make their homes. They’re actually able to “smell” dead or dying
                                                 snails, which can lead them to a potential shell. But competition for
                                                 such shells can be fierce. Hermit crabs may fight to the death in pursuit
                                                 of a shell. And, as they grow, they must seek out new shells in which
                                                 to live.<br> Contrary to their name, hermit crabs aren’t solitary creatures.
                                                 In the wild, they’re found in groups of 100 or more. Social behavior
                                                 in hermit crabs is also sometimes observed during mating, when the male
                                                 may stroke and tap the female’s claws—or grab her shell and carry her
                                                 around!—before mating begins. </P>

                                                <p>The young develop in stages, with the first two (the nauplius and protozoea)
                                                 occurring inside the egg. Most hermit crab larvae hatch at the third
                                                 stage, the zoea. In this larval stage, the crab has several long spines,
                                                 a long, narrow abdomen, and large fringed antennae. Several zoealmoults
                                                 are followed by the final larval stage, the megalopa. Hermit crabs are
                                                 often seen as a "throwaway pet" that would live only a few months, but
                                                 species such as Coenobitaclypeatus have a 23-year lifespan if properly
                                                 treated,[18] and some have lived longer than 32 years.</P>

                                                <p>Tridacnagigas is one of the most endangered clam species. Antonio Pigafetta
                                                 documented these in his journal as early as 1521. One of a number of
                                                 large clam species native to the shallow coral reefs of the South Pacific
                                                 and Indian oceans, they can weigh more than 200 kilograms (440 lb), measure
                                                 as much as 120 cm (47 in) across, and have an average lifespan in the
                                                 wild of over 100 years. They are also found off the shores of the Philippines,
                                                 where they are called "taklobo", and in the South China Sea in the coral
                                                 reefs of Sabah (Malaysian Borneo). Tridacnagigas lives in flat coral
                                                 sand or broken coral and can be found at depths of as much as 20 m (66
                                                 ft). Its range covers the Indo-Pacific, but populations are diminishing
                                                 quickly and the giant clam has become extinct in many areas where it
                                                 was once common. Tridacna maxima has the largest geographical distribution
                                                 among giant clam species; it can be found off high- or low-elevation
                                                 islands, in lagoons or fringing reefs. Its rapid growth rate is likely

                                                <p>Algae provide giant clams with a supplementary source of nutrition. These
                                                 plants consist of unicellular algae, whose metabolic products add to
                                                 the clam's filter food. As a result, they are able to grow as large as
                                                 one meter in length even in nutrient-poor coral-reef waters. The clams
                                                 cultivate algae in a special circulatory system which enables them to
                                                 keep a substantially higher number of symbionts per unit of volume.</P>

                                                <p>Giant clams live in partnership with tiny plant-like algae. The algae get
                                                 protection and the clams get to eat the sugars and proteins produced
                                                 by the billions of algae that live in their tissues. Giant clams live
                                                 on shallow reefs because if they live too deep, there is not enough sunlight
                                                 for the algae to photosynthesize and create the food that helps giant
                                                 clams grow so big.<br> Giant clams have an undeserved reputation as man-eaters,
                                                 with legends describing clams that lie in wait to trap unsuspecting swimmers
                                                 and swallow them whole. No account of a human death by giant clam has
                                                 ever been substantiated and scientists point out that the clam’s adductor
                                                 muscles, the muscles used to close the shell, move far too slowly to
                                                 take a swimmer by surprise. While the legends make good plots for B movies,
                                                 the truth is much tamer. Giant clams eat mostly sunshine—more precisely
                                                 sunlight converted to food by symbiotic algae—with a side of plankton.</P>

                                                </h4>
                                                <p>Tridacnagigas reproduce sexually and are hermaphrodites (producing both eggs
                                                 and sperm). Self-fertilization is not possible, but this characteristic
                                                 does allow them to reproduce with any other member of the species. This
                                                 reduces the burden of finding a compatible mate, while simultaneously
                                                 doubling the number of offspring produced by the process. As with all
                                                 other forms of sexual reproduction, hermaphroditism ensures that new
                                                 gene combinations be passed to further generations.<br>Since giant clams
                                                 cannot move themselves, they adopt broadcast spawning, releasing sperm
                                                 and eggs into the water. A transmitter substance called spawning induced
                                                 substance (SIS) helps synchronize the release of sperm and eggs to ensure
                                                 fertilization. The substance is released through a syphonal outlet. Other
                                                 clams can detect SIS immediately. Incoming water passes chemoreceptors
                                                 situated close to the incurrent syphon, which transmit the information
                                                 directly to the cerebral ganglia, a simple form of brain.<br>Detection
                                                 of SIS stimulates the giant clam to swell its mantle in the central region
                                                 and to contract its adductor muscle. Each clam then fills its water chambers
                                                 and closes the incurrent syphon. The shell contracts vigorously with
                                                 the adductor's help, so the excurrent chamber's contents flows through
                                                 the excurrent syphon. After a few contractions containing only water,
                                                 eggs and sperm appear in the excurrent chamber and then pass through
                                                 the excurrent syphon into the water. Female eggs have a diameter of 100
                                                 micrometres (0.0039 in). Egg release initiates the reproductive process.
                                                 An adult T. gigas can release more than 500 million eggs at a time.</P>
