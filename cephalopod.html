                                            </h4>
                                            <p>The chambered nautilus is one of six species of nautilus, the only cephalopods 
                                                (squids, octopuses, and relatives) that have external shells. Like in most shelled 
                                                animals, this species can retract completely into its shell when threatened. The chambered 
                                                nautilus lives in deep waters of the open ocean and is one of very few species of shelled 
                                                invertebrates that live in the water column instead of in contact with the seafloor or reef 
                                                surface. The animal only lives in the outermost chamber of the shell. The other chambers are 
                                                filled with gas that helps the chambered nautilus remain neutrally buoyant, giving it the ability to hover in the water.
                                                </P>

                                            <p>The chambered nautilus is both an active predator and a scavenger.  It typically hunts for 
                                                benthic crustaceans or other invertebrates, but it is not selective when scavenging.  
                                                This species has as many as 90 appendages, unlike the octopuses and squids, which have eight or ten.  
                                                Furthermore, the chambered nautilus does not have suckers on its tentacles, and obtains food by wrapping 
                                                several tentacles around its prey and pulling the prey toward its mouth. 
                                                </P>

                                            <p>This species reproduces via internal fertilization.  Males have modified tentacles 
                                                that they use to pass sperm to females.  Females then attach fertilized eggs to
                                                 hard substrates on the seafloor, where they remain for up to a full year before hatching.  
                                                 Newly hatched juveniles already have well developed (though tiny) shells.  
                                                 The chambered nautilus is one of the longest living cephalopods, reaching ages of over 20 years old.  
                                                 The nautiluses are also the only cephalopods that reproduce multiple times.  
                                                Squids, octopuses, and other cephalopods die after they reproduce once.</P>

                                            <p>Octopuses live in every ocean, and different species have adapted to different
                                                marine habitats. As juveniles, common octopuses inhabit shallow tide
                                                pools. The Hawaiian day octopus (Octopus cyanea) lives on coral reefs;
                                                argonauts drift in pelagic waters. Abdopusaculeatus mostly lives in near-shore
                                                seagrass beds. Some species are adapted to the cold, ocean depths. The
                                                spoon-armed octopus (Bathypolypusarcticus) is found in abyssal plains
                                                at depths of 1,000 m (3,300 ft), and Vulcanoctopushydrothermalis lives
                                                near hydrothermal vents at 2,000 m (6,600 ft). The cirrate species are
                                                often free-swimming and live in deep-water habitats. No species are known

                                            <p>Octopuses bring captured prey back to the den where they can eat it safely.
                                                Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and the den
                                                is often surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items. Other
                                                creatures, such as fish, crabs, molluscs and echinoderms, often share
                                                the den with the octopus, either because they have arrived as scavengers,

                                                at night. They use their arms, each covered with approximately 200 suckers,
                                                to find and hold their prey. Depending on the type of prey, they may
                                                paralyze prey such as fish with a toxic saliva, then tear into it with
                                                their parrot-like beak. Or, they may simply pull their prey’s defenses
                                                apart (as with crab shells) to get at the meal within.<br>Giant Pacific
                                                octopuses can change color at will, expressing mood, comfort level and
                                                intentions to nearby animals. They’re also able to change texture, using

                                            <p>Octopuses are gonochoric and have a single, posteriorly-located gonad which
                                                is associated with the coelom. The testis in males and the ovary in females
                                                bulges into the gonocoel and the gametes are released here. The gonocoel
                                                is connected by the gonoduct to the mantle cavity, which it enters at
                                                the gonopore. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus
                                                to mature and age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered
                                                by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition,
                                                which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan. When octopuses
                                                reproduce, the male uses a specialised arm called a hectocotylus to transfer
                                                spermatophores (packets of sperm) from the terminal organ of the reproductive
                                                tract (the cephalopod "penis") into the female's mantle cavity. The hectocotylus
                                                in benthic octopuses is usually the third right arm, which has a spoon-shaped
                                                depression and modified suckers near the tip. In most species, fertilisation
                                                occurs in the mantle cavity</P>

                                                    of South America. Like all hermit crabs, an individual of this species carries 
                                                    around a heavy shell that it uses for protection. It does not build this shell, however. 
                                                    Instead, it scavenges an empty snail shell from a variety of species and carries the shell 
                                                    with its tail and abdomen. As the colorful hermit crab ages, it must find new, larger shells 
                                                    that can accommodate its growing body.

                                                        are possible synonyms. It reaches 7 centimeters in mantle length; males
